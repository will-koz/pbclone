calculus
The relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals is given by the second part of the
fundamental theorem of which branch of mathematics?

Jack Kerouac
What Beat Generation figure fictionalized himself as Sal Paradise in his novel On the Road?

Kurt Vonnegut
In a story by this author, Helene and Henry Nash fall in love when they meet as actors in a
production of A Streetcar Named Desire, then ask variants of the title question as they are cast as
lovers in other famous plays. He used the term mouse-traps to describe the twist endings in his
stories, such as Who Am I This Time? He wrote a story in which Nancy McLuhan is kidnapped by the
Nothinghead Billy the Poet, who refuses to take Ethical Birth Control drugs. He wrote a story that
culminates in a levitating dance between a ballerina named the Empress and the title character, a
kid with above-average intelligence who is killed by the Handicapper General Diana Glampers. For 10
points, name this author of Welcome to the Monkey House, Harrison Bergeron, and Slaughterhouse-Five.

Lake Chad
What lake fed by the Chari River has shrunk drastically as the Sahara Desert has expanded and is
near N'Djamena in its namesake African country?

Nero
What man, who said what an artist dies with me as he expired at the start of the Year of the Four
Emperors, allegedly fiddled in AD 64 as Rome burned?

quantum entanglement
A system has this property if it has only one non-zero coefficient in its Schmidt decomposition.
Bell pairs have this property maximally. It explains a thought experiment in which the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle appears to be inconsistent with relativity, called the EPR paradox. Two
particles can have properties linked by -- for 10 points -- what quantum phenomenon that Einstein
called spooky action at a distance?

two
Goldbach's conjecture suggests that the sum of exactly this many primes can be used to express every
even integer greater than this number. Mersenne primes are of the form one less than a power of this
number. Twin primes are groups of prime numbers separated by this value, which is the first value
used in the Sieve of Eratosthenes to eliminate composite numbers from the list of integers. For ten
points, name this only even prime number.
