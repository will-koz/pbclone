# TODO

other than running `grep TODO` or something, here are some features that will be implemented:

- [ ] Add a notification for pauses
- [ ] Add more questions (Like 100? is that a good number?)
- [ ] CSS Styling
- [ ] Get more screenshots
- [ ] Handle last names?
- [x] Make a help menu / panel
- [ ] Make a presentable README
- [ ] Make pause a separate color
